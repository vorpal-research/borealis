These benchmarks test handling of interprocedural dataflow analysis. 
As such, the general assumption is that memory allocation does not fail. 
Furthermore, memory leaks are currently not treated as bugs either.

The following test cases have the respected number of bugs: 

ex3.c --> 1
ex4.c --> 1
ex12.c
ex13.c --> 1
ex20.c --> 2
ex26.c --> 1
ex27.c --> 1
ex28.c --> 1
ex36.c --> 2
ex39.c --> 1 (using bit-precise modeling)
ex40.c --> 5
ex41.c --> 4
ex43.c --> 4
ex49.c --> 1 (using bit-precise modeling)
inf1.c --> 1 
inf4.c --> 1 
inf5.c --> 1

Assuming malloc may return NULL, additional errors may occur.
 
ex8.c --> 1
ex30.c --> 2
ex37.c --> 1 
ex46.c --> 2
ex47.c --> 1 (2, if free(NULL) is considered a bug)
inf2.c --> 1

Memory leaks are not tracked as of now.
